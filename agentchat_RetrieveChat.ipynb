    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Using RetrieveChat for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a conversational system for retrieval-augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially, `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and  `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implement a different auto-reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of Contents\n",
    "We'll demonstrate six examples of using RetrieveChat for code generation and question answering:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 1: Generate code based off docstrings w/o human feedback](#example-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 2: Answer a question based off docstrings w/o human feedback](#example-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 3: Generate code based off docstrings w/ human feedback](#example-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 4: Answer a question based off docstrings w/ human feedback](#example-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 5: Solve comprehensive QA problems with RetrieveChat's unique feature `Update Context`](#example-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 6: Solve comprehensive QA problems with customized prompt and few-shot learning](#example-6)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install the [retrievechat] option.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install \"pyautogen[retrievechat]~=0.2.0b5\" \"flaml[automl]\"\n",
